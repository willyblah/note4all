# Note4All

Note4All is a **public note-taking web app**. Everyone can view and edit other
people's notes, making Note4All a great place to share knowledge. You can also
use Note4All to transfer text across devices and create anonymous online chat
rooms.

## Website

Note4All is hosted on GitHub pages: <https://willyblah.github.io/note4all/>

An overview of Note4All can be found in the `note4all` note.

## Rules

- Do NOT post harmful or inappropriate content.
- Do NOT delete or modify other people's notes without permission.
- Do NOT use scripts or bots to create or edit notes.
- Do NOT create extremely large notes. Note4All uses a free Firebase database,
  which has a storage limit of 1GB.

There is no way to punish people who fail to obey these rules, but hopefully,
everyone can work together to build a wonderful Note4All community.

## Usage

Enter a note name at the top, then click "Open" or press Enter. If the note does
not exist, it will be created. If it already exists, it will be opened. Your
notes will be saved automatically.

## Future Plans

- Add note URLs for easier note sharing
- Add support for markdown notes
